WHAD C/C++ library for compatible firmwares
===========================================

This library provides a set of functions and classes that makes the communication
with a WHAD host easier.

Documentation
-------------

Coming soon (we promise), meanwhile the code is fully documented. You can also have a
look at our nRF52 compatible firmware called [ButteRFly](https://github.com/whad-team/butterfly) that uses it.
